# Wallet Analysis: High and Low Credit Score Patterns in Compound V2

## Five High-Scoring Wallets (Scores 34.73-100.00)

The highest-scoring wallets demonstrate several consistent behavioral patterns that indicate reliable and responsible protocol usage:

### Wallet 0x29fe7d60ddf151e5b52e5fab4f1325da6b2bd958 (Score: 100.00)
This wallet shows exemplary behavior with a substantial transaction history (106.87 transactions). The regular cadence of interactions (low std_hours_between_txs of -0.29) suggests a consistent, automated strategy rather than erratic usage. Its positive PCA1 (4.68) and PCA2 (2.73) values indicate it falls into a cluster of wallets with healthy interaction patterns.

### Wallet 0xaa6e8127831c9de45ae56bb1b0d4d4da6e5665bd (Score: 59.08)
With 56.81 transactions over an extended account age (2.55 days), this wallet demonstrates sustained engagement with the protocol. Its consistency in transaction timing (similar to other high scorers) coupled with a positive PCA1 (4.76) suggests responsible capital management without signs of exploitative behavior.

### Wallet 0x00000000001876eb1444c986fd502e618c587430 (Score: 51.43)
Despite having fewer transactions (48.88) than the top scorer, this wallet maintains similar timing patterns. Its PCA values (2.07, 1.90) place it in the same behavioral cluster as top performers, suggesting similar protocol interaction quality without the same volume.

### Wallet 0xa2b47e3d5c44877cca798226b7b8118f9bfb7a56 (Score: 43.94)
This wallet shows moderate activity (40.12 transactions) with consistent timing. Its positive PCA values align with healthy protocol usage patterns, though at somewhat lower volumes than the highest scorers.

### Wallet 0xf859a1ad94bcf445a406b892ef0d3082f4174088 (Score: 34.73)
Despite having fewer transactions (28.55), this wallet maintains the temporal consistency seen in other high scorers. Its distinctive PCA profile (3.13, -1.18) suggests it may represent a different but still responsible usage pattern, perhaps emphasizing certain Compound V2 features over others.

## Five Low-Scoring Wallets (Scores 9.99-10.00)

The lowest-scoring wallets exhibit concerning transaction patterns indicative of potential exploitation, bot behavior, or protocol misuse:

### Wallet 0xa4517a2b21f85f6a6a63601cea7fa4e34da92856 (Score: 10.00)
This wallet shows minimal protocol engagement (0.20 transactions) with a short account lifetime (0.73 days). Its negative PCA2 value (-0.92) coupled with positive but low PCA1 (0.93) places it in a cluster associated with potentially exploitative or speculative short-term behavior.

### Wallet 0x241e1aac00ef9b5f8f22a9bd63c8e6b05bc709ba (Score: 10.00)
With extremely limited activity (0.14 transactions) despite a moderate account age (1.03 days), this wallet shows signs of dormancy or opportunistic usage. Its PCA values (1.53, -1.16) suggest it may be part of a coordinated network of wallets showing similar patterns.

### Wallet 0xffc5924dd727e6f081ef16b68403b8b322d870ec (Score: 10.00)
This wallet exhibits unusual temporal patterns with negative first_tx_time (-1.11) and negative last_tx_time (-1.04), suggesting activity concentrated in atypical time periods. The negative PCA1 (-1.08) contrasts sharply with high scorers, placing it in a distinctly different behavioral cluster.

### Wallet 0x58ad03b52aca614be263f34305b4659a66e4725a (Score: 9.99)
Despite a moderate account age (1.71 days), this wallet shows minimal activity (0.16 transactions). Its extraordinarily high standard deviation in transaction timing (1.04) indicates irregular, unpredictable interaction with the protocol. The high PCA1 (2.43) combined with negative PCA2 (-0.63) suggests a pattern potentially associated with MEV extraction or other sophisticated strategies.

### Wallet 0xe9947f9d6137be1efc8525384c49e964aeb4bcd9 (Score: 9.99)
This wallet shows limited engagement (0.29 transactions) with highly variable transaction timing (std_hours_between_txs of 0.77). Its PCA values (1.70, -0.46) place it in a cluster associated with sporadic or opportunity-seeking behavior rather than consistent protocol participation.

## Key Differentiating Factors

1. **Transaction Volume**: High scorers consistently show substantially higher transaction counts (28.55-106.87 vs. 0.14-0.29).
2. **Temporal Consistency**: High scorers demonstrate more regular transaction timing patterns (lower standard deviations).
3. **PCA Clustering**: The two-dimensional PCA representation clearly separates responsible users (typically positive on both dimensions) from potentially exploitative ones.
4. **Account Utilization**: High scorers show more sustained and productive usage throughout their account lifetime.

This scoring system effectively identifies wallets demonstrating consistent, reliable protocol interaction versus those showing minimal, erratic, or potentially exploitative behaviors.
